# Simple Start
Simple Start is a collection of libraries of services and functions that I find myself writing in almost every project. Here are a list of available libraries:
- [Simple Start Core](https://github.com/derekwelton/SimpleStart/tree/main/SimpleStart.Core)
a number of extensions and services I use in in almost every project
- [Simple Start Auth Firebase](https://github.com/derekwelton/SimpleStart/tree/main/SimpleStart.Auth.Firebase)
A simplified way of using firebase as the main authentication provider in your asp net core application.
